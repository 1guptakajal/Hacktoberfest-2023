I am an Undergrad. student in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University of Lagos, and I am affiliated with the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory](http://airol.unilag.edu.ng/). I am interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud Technologies, as well as applications of technology in healthcare and education.

In addition to my academic activities, I am actively involved in tech communities and I constantly share my knowledge and experience in AI, IoT, Cloud technologies - particularly Microsoft Azure, and GitHub for open source. I also serve as a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/salimcodes/) and [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors/profile/8c4773d7-5893-4dfd-ad9f-1c20cbd73b6a) in my school. Furthermore, I author technical articles on everything between Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. In that regard, I try to approach technical writing as a story-telling experience.
