Organization August XX, 2022
Dear Members of the Recruiting Team:
I am looking for the position of Software Development Engineer . I believe my two years of coding
and development experience and past internship, alongside my education, make me a viable candidate.
I am a senior-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna,
majoring in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering alongside relevant coursework in computer
science like C, C++, Data Science, and Python. I’m interested in pursuing a career in software
engineering because I have been curious about software development since my first year. I have worked
as a software development intern in different organizations.
I started with web development at IIT Patna during my bachelor’s as a hobby. I have designed the
backend for the Job posting portal for E-Cell Club. I was the technical lead for the web team during
Inter-IIT Tech meet for the mid-prep ISRO - Solar burst detection event where we secured the twelfth
rank among all IITs. I am a fast learner and thrilled by challenges. During my internships, I learned
Material-UI for Bhumio Inc., python and jinja2 while working for Bytelearn Edtech, and latex to
build my r´esum´e and this cover letter, and CSS animations to power my website. I have designed the
feature to add an event in google calendar for Bhumio which will be used by thousands of users. Also
have contributed thousands of lines of code that will be used by thousands of US students daily at
Bytelearn. I have coded the config file and wrote comprehensive documentation for all the config
files for future contributors. I gained hands-on experience coding under the direction of a team,
collaborating on software, and design discussion. I make it a point to write test cases,
self-documenting code, and code formatting.
I want to join this organization because it will give me a platform where I can implement the skills
knowledge I acquired from my education as well as it will give me a chance to learn from my seniors
implements the learning for the betterment of the organization.
I would request you to please take a moment to review my resume , which follows this page. I
genuinely believe I have the dedication, skills, and experience needed not only to get the job done but
also done well. If any more information is required of me, I’ll be happy to provide it.
Thank you for considering my application and reading through this verbose cover letter!
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Regards
Abhay Tiwari
